\description{
Retrieves 6S radiative transfer model paremeters from the 6S web interface \url{https://www-loa.univ-lille1.fr/Wsixs/}. The parameters can be used to atmospherically correct VENÂµS satellite images.
}
\details{
The 6S radiative transfer model relates the top of the atmosphere reflectance or radiance (TOA) with the reflectance at satellite height, and the surface reflectance, using information about the atmospheric conditions, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and water vapor (WV) content (Vermote et al. 1997). 
The atmospheric correction coefficients (Xa, Xb, Xc) returned by the function can be used to calculate bottom of the atmosphere (BOM) reflectance from top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance using the following formulas (1) and (2) (Zhao, Tamura, and Takahashi 2001):

(1) y = Xa*TOA-Xb

(2) BOA = y / (1+Xc*y)

where 'y' is an intermediate variable, 'TOA' is the top of the atmosphere radiance, 'BOA' is the bottom of the atmosphere reflectance, and 'Xa', 'Xb', 'Xc' are the correction coefficents returned by the \code{sixs_params} function.
